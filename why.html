                    Portal guns are a science fiction concept that remains to be rather interesting. If this work of fiction were to become reality, it would be a scientific breakthrough and pave the way for much more in the field of science. Portal guns could be used in the real world for a variety of activities, including teleportation, warfare, construction, and more.
